# Basic

This file has a basic Python code block with errors.

Here is a code block with malformed quotation marks:

```python
print("I don't know how to use quotation marks')
```

This code block references an undefined variable:

```python
print(undefined_variable)
```

This code block uses the shorthand py and has an unused import

```py
import os


print('hello hello world')
```
